4855 Scouter
============
## Version 2020.5.1

Before you use this program at a competition, please ensure that you are using the latest version. Check with your lead scouter to ensure that you are.

### Installation

If you're reading this, then you're either on GitHub or your scouter is already installed. If you're on GitHub, you can download this whole folder to your device and unzip it to a secure location on your device. If you're already all installed, then congratulations!

### How to Run

Double-click the index.html file. This should open up your default browser and begin the scouting program. The recommended browsers to use for the scouter are Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox. Using any other browsers is discouraged, as the scouter has not been thoroughly tested in any other environments.

### Basic Usage

You will be greeted with a screen that asks whether you are a scouter or if you are the master scouter. Do not switch between scouter or master scouter, as this can cause discrepencies and break the program. If you need to switch between the two for any reason, make sure you export wherever you are at to save your data and click Reset data.

There are two types of forms: match forms and verbal forms. Match forms should be used strictly during matchplay, and they require you to record the event and the qualification match number of the match you're watching. Be sure this is accurate, as this information plays a key role in the backend processes of the scouter. Verbal forms should be used when walking from team-to-team and asking for information. Only one verbal form is necessary per event.

As a scouter, every new scouting report you make is assigned a unique ID. For the most part, the ID is not really important for general use unless special debugging must be done. All of your reports will be saved if you X out of the window and return, but DO NOT COUNT ON YOUR DATA SAVING AFTER SHUTTING YOUR DEVICE DOWN.

### Exporting

When you are ready to hand your data over to the master scouter, click the Export data button. This should place a file named data-XXXXXX.json (with the Xs replaced with randomized numbers) in your Downloads folder. Check your Downloads folder to access the file, but do not alter the content of the file. This file should be sent to the master scouter.

You do not have to reset your data after an export if you wish. Any further exports you complete will still include all your data, however when the master scouter imports your data it will not include any duplicates.

### Master Scouter: Importing and Exporting

As a master scouter, you can import any .json files into the program that have scouting information in them. Upon importing, the data of other scouters will populate your scouting database, and you can use this information to simulate matches, draft picklists, and generate team overviews.

When you export your data, a file named MASTERDUMP-XXXXXX.json will manifest itself in your Downloads folder. This can be renamed whatever you'd like it to be if you wish to keep it for further reference. It is HIGHLY recommended that you export as often as possible to ensure you do not lose your data. You should also keep all scouter data files given to you, as reimporting a batch of files will not produce duplicates and having backups is recommended.
