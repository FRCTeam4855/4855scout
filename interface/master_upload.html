		<h1>IMPORT DATA</h1>
		<p style="text-align: center;">
			Scouting data exists in the form of .json files. When your scouters have data ready for you (or if you've previously exported data that you would like to analyze), you can load that data onto your database here. You may import as many .json files as you wish at once including any duplicates, as duplicate scouting forms will not be added to your database multiple times. It is advised that you don't delete the original .json files after importing them, as you may need them for backup.
